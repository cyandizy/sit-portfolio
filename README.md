# SIT Porfolio

The website version of my portfolio for SIT KMUTT admission.

It is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern web framework for content-driven websites, alongside a CSS framework [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The website can be viewed [here](https://ilialyl.github.io/sit-portfolio/).
