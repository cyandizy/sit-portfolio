        It all occurred to me when I was 16 years old. Having chosen an
        “Introduction to Web Programming” class, I came into a realization that
        art of programming is not out of my reach. From there I continued to
        explore various topics, from scripting languages like Python, to low
        level languages such as C and Rust. I could not and still cannot imagine
        any other fields I can enjoy other than the field of Computer Science.
        After high school graduation, I took a gap year to learn about the
        outside of Thailand. I went to Curtin College in Perth, Australia to
        study Diploma of Information and Technology (Computer Science), where I
        faced multiple challenges and learned from them. As I have completed my
        diploma, I have been continuously learning new topics, such as
        Cybersecurity and Game Development. All of this is to show that, I,
        indeed, take this path of Computer Science seriously. For now I look
        forward to studying at School of Information and Technology (SIT) at
        King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) where I
        originally intended to attend.
